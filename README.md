1. Supervised Learning
Supervised Learning is one of the foundational techniques in Machine Learning. It involves training a model using a labeled dataset, where each training example has corresponding inputs and outputs. The objective is for the model to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs, so it can make accurate predictions on unseen data.

In this demo, we'll build a simple image classifier using Logistic Regression. The scikit-learn library will be used for implementation.

2. Weakly Supervised Learning
Weakly Supervised Learning is designed to handle partially labeled data, where obtaining precise and abundant labels for all training examples is challenging or costly. One popular technique in Weakly Supervised Learning is "Multiple Instance Learning" (MIL). It operates on bags of instances, where each bag contains multiple instances, but only the bag itself is labeled. The model learns to identify patterns within the instances to make predictions for the entire bag.

In this demo, we'll create a simple MIL classifier using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The scikit-learn library will be used for implementation.

3. Self-Supervised Learning
Self-Supervised Learning is a semi-supervised approach where the model generates its own labels from the given data. It achieves this by creating a pretext task, which is an auxiliary task related to the primary task of interest. Solving the pretext task helps the model learn representations that can be transferred to the primary task, even with limited labeled data.

In this demo, we'll implement a simple Self-Supervised Learning technique using TensorFlow. We will build a model to fill in missing parts of images.
